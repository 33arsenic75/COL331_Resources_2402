I am uploading only my assignments and not the minor and major exam paper as they didn't went well, and would not like to comment upon the genius rubrics they had. Although I did manage to salvage some marks in assignment. With a score of 40.5/45 combining all assignments. Note that I did the easy track in all these assignments.
